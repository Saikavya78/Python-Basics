Day 2 – Conditions & Loops

Conditional Statements

Used to make decisions based on conditions.

Example:

x = 10
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative")

✅ Comparison Operators

==: Equal

!=: Not equal

<, >, <=, >=: Less/Greater than

✅ Logical Operators

and: True if both are true

or: True if at least one is true

not: Reverse the result

✅ Loops: for and while

Example: for loop

for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints 0 to 4

Example: while loop

count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1

✅ Loop Control

break: exits the loop

continue: skips to next iteration

pass: does nothing (used as a placeholder)

✅ Practice Examples

Print even or odd number:
num = 7
if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")

Print numbers divisible by 3 from 1 to 100:
for i in range(1, 101):
    if i % 3 == 0:
        print(i)
